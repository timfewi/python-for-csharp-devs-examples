# Chapter 2: Collections and Data Structures

## Overview
This chapter introduces Python's built-in collection types and compares them to their C# equivalents. You'll learn how Python's dynamic typing and built-in methods make working with collections more intuitive and powerful.

## Topics Covered

### 2.1 Lists (`chapter2_lists.py`)
- Python lists vs C# List<T> and arrays
- List operations, methods, and comprehensions
- Slicing and indexing
- Mutable vs immutable concepts

### 2.2 Dictionaries (`chapter2_dictionaries.py`)
- Python dictionaries vs C# Dictionary<TKey, TValue>
- Key-value operations and methods
- Dictionary comprehensions
- Common patterns and use cases

### 2.3 Tuples and Sets (`chapter2_tuples_sets.py`)
- Tuples: immutable sequences vs C# ValueTuple
- Sets: unique collections vs C# HashSet<T>
- When to use each collection type
- Set operations and methods

### 2.4 Classes and Objects (`chapter2_classes.py`)
- Object-oriented programming in Python vs C#
- Class definition and instantiation
- Properties, methods, and constructors
- Inheritance and method overriding

### 2.5 Exercise (`exercise2_1.py`)
- Practical exercise combining all collection types
- Building a student management system
- Data processing and reporting

## Key Concepts for C# Developers

1. **Dynamic Typing**: Python collections can hold mixed types
2. **Built-in Methods**: Rich set of methods available on all collection types
3. **Comprehensions**: Concise syntax for creating collections
4. **Truthiness**: Empty collections evaluate to False
5. **Immutability**: Understanding when objects can/cannot be modified

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand Python's main collection types and their C# equivalents
- Know when to use lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- Be able to create and manipulate collections effectively
- Understand basic object-oriented programming in Python
- Apply collection concepts in practical scenarios

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Chapter 1 (variables, strings, control flow, functions)
- Basic understanding of C# collections (List<T>, Dictionary<K,V>, etc.)
